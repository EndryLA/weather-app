After getting the theory of APIs & Object Oriented Programming, i decided that i need to apply it in a project so i could better understand it.( It was actually a very fun project,I loved it !)



Neither the Visual clarity or the Layout of the project were the main concern of this project. I was more focused on learning new tools than doing a aesthetic app.


things I learned : 

Some aspescts of javascript, i had some knowledge on just the theorical aspect of it.
→ This is the first time i used switch statements on a project, usually i only used it in isolated exercices.
→ This is the first time i use the constructor on a project too.
